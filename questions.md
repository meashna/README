1. Birth Control:
   - After stopping different types of birth control (e.g., pills, IUD), how many cycles on average until ovulation patterns stabilize?
   - How does recent birth control usage (within the last 3–6 months) alter the expected fertile window or cycle length?

2. Cycle Length and Variation:
   - How should we adjust predictions for users with cycle lengths outside the 21–35 day range?
   - If a user reports that their cycle length varies a lot month-to-month, what baseline assumption should we use for estimating ovulation?

3. Bleeding Duration and Flow:
   - Does the duration of bleeding (e.g., 3 days vs. 7 days) affect the timing of ovulation or the fertile window calculations?
   - Should heavy flow or passing clots indicate a need to adjust predicted ovulation or next period start dates?

4. Fertility Treatments:
   - If the user is undergoing fertility treatments like ovulation induction, what adjustments should we make to standard ovulation day predictions?
   - For IVF or IUI users, are standard cycle calculations still relevant, or should we provide a different type of prediction?

5. User-Reported Data Accuracy:
   - How should we handle user-entered data when it’s incomplete or inconsistent? For example, if they only logged one cycle, how reliable are predictions?
   - Is there a recommended minimum number of logged cycles before predictions become more accurate?

6. Age and Health:
   - Should we incorporate a user’s age directly into the probability of conception (chances of conceiving) calculations?
   - Are there any warning signs (irregularities, extremely long/short cycles) that we should account for by showing less confident predictions?

7. Normalization Period:
   - If a user recently changed their birth control method or just stopped it, how many months of new data should we gather before trusting predictive calculations?

8. Simple Adjustments:
   - When cycle data is missing or erratic, is it better to assume average values (like a 28-day cycle) or to not display predictions until more data is collected?

These simplified, app-focused questions can guide the development of your algorithm by clarifying how each piece 
of user input should influence your cycle and fertility predictions.
